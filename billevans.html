        style="margin-top: 35px;">Baker earned much attention and critical praise through the 1950s, particularly for albums featuring his vocals (Chet Baker Sings, It Could Happen to You).<br>
        Jazz historian Dave Gelly described the promise of Baker's early career as "James Dean, Sinatra, and Bix, rolled into one".<br>
        His well-publicized drug habit also drove his notoriety and fame.<br>
        Baker was in and out of jail frequently before enjoying a career resurgence in the late 1970s and 1980s.</p>
